The MWI tool includes two main features:

-   How to explore mental wellness at the State level

-   How to explore mental wellness at the ZIP Code level

Here you can find instructions on how to use the MWI, as well as videos and use cases to also guide you.

**How to Use the Explore States Tab**

The Explore States option allows you to explore the MWI through an interactive map and distribution visualization. This option is useful if you would like to focus on a particular state or compare a ZIP Code to state-wide rankings.

To explore this option, you can:

-   Select population to view (either Overall or Black),

-   Select either a specific state or the entire country ("All" states),

-   Select to explore either the overall MWI or an individual measure.

-   Select a ZIP Code within their selected state by entering the numeric ZIP Code under "Exploration Options," or by clicking on a ZIP Code on the interactive map.

You can also explore the MWI by hovering over ZIP Codes on the map, or by hovering over points on the interactive distribution.
