The MWI tool includes two main features:

-   How to explore mental wellness at the State level

-   How to explore mental wellness at the ZIP Code level

Here you can find instructions on how to use the MWI, as well as videos and use cases to also guide you.

**How to Use the Explore States Tab**

The Explore States option allows you to explore the MWI through an interactive map and distribution visualization. This option is useful if you would like to focus on a particular state or compare a ZIP Code to state-wide rankings.

To explore this option, you can:

-   Select population to view (either Overall or Black),

-   Select either a specific state or the entire country ("All" states),

-   Select to explore either the overall MWI or an individual measure.

-   Select a ZIP Code within their selected state by entering the numeric ZIP Code under "Exploration Options," or by clicking on a ZIP Code on the interactive map.

You can also explore the MWI by hovering over ZIP Codes on the map, or by hovering over points on the interactive distribution.

**How to Use the Explore Zip Codes Tab**

The Explore Zip Codes option provides a community overview that shows the MWI and each individual measure for a specific ZIP Code. This page is useful to see all measures for a ZIP Code, or to focus on areas (which may cross state lines) surrounding a ZIP Code.

To explore this option, you can:

-   Select population to view (either Overall or Black),

-   Select to explore either the overall MWI or an individual measure from the drop down menu,

-   Select a ZIP Code by entering the numeric ZIP Code under "Exploration Options," or by clicking on a ZIP Code on the interactive map,

-   Explore the overall Mental Wellness Index for the ZIP Code selected and how it ranked in the state,

-   View how each measure ranked for that community.

**Use Case: Using the MWI to Understand the Mental Health Needs of a Community**

An organization in Baltimore, MD works to improve educational outcomes for youth and ensure families are healthy and successful in the West Baltimore area. They are conducting a community participatory budgeting process this summer to decide how to allocate their funding.

**Plan community conversations to review the MWI!**

The non-profit meets with members of the West Baltimore community to talk about the drivers of overall mental wellness, poor mental health and substance use disorders in their community. They guide the conversation following the three steps below.

**Step 1: Review Measures in the MWI**

The MWI includes 28 measures organized under three domains: Social Determinants of Health, Healthcare Access, and Health Status. The organization and community members explore the Mental Wellness Index of their community.

The organization enters the ZIP code in the MWI tool for their community to see the overall Mental Wellness Index measure. To do so, they follow these steps:

-   Go to the MWI tool, select "Maryland" from the drop-down menu, and select "Start Exploring!

-   Since the group is interested in a community in a specific zip code, they select the "Explore ZIP Codes" option:

-   The group is interested in seeing the Mental Wellness Index for the Black population living in their zip code, so they go to the "Exploration Options" section and select "Black" for "Which population's MWI do you want to view?":

-   As a group they have decided to look at the overall Mental Wellness Index first so they select "Mental Wellness Index" from the drop-down menu under "What measure would you like to focus on?"

-   The group starts exploring the tool by entering the ZIP Code number, which gives them the opportunity to take a closer look at their community:

**Step 2: Explore MWI Score and Measures**

The group decides to take a closer look at the MWI score and measures results for their community.

-   On the right hand-side they see their community has an overall Mental Wellness Index score of 22, a low score compared to the rest of the nation.

-   They also notice their community Mental Wellness is low compared to the Mental Wellness Index of their state.

<center>![](images/explore2.png)</center>

-   To better understand what are the specific Mental Wellness areas that need to be targeted to improve the mental wellness of their community, they explore the score for each individual measure. They focus on those with a lower score as those indicate more obstacles to mental wellness.

**Step 3: Identify Priority Mental Wellness Factors**

Based on their community conversations and review of the measures in the MWI, the organization selects three measures to prioritize as part of their budget decision making process.

-   Voter participation (a measure of social capital),

-   No high school diploma (an education measure), and

-   Unemployment (a measure of employment.

Now the organization and community members can discuss and make a data-informed decision on how to best allocate funds to support their community!

**How to Customize the MWI**

You can customize the MWI to meet your needs. The MWI includes 28 measures, however, communities might have other important wellbeing factors they would like to include in their analysis which are not included as part of the baseline framework. It can be modified in the following ways:

-   Removing measures

-   Adding and replacing measures and data sets

-   Modifying measure weights
