<center>*The driving force behind the MWI is that equity delivered to historically marginalized populations will accrue to others and potentially catalyze movement toward social and racial justice.*</center>

The MWI framework contains three domains and two dynamic factors.

[**Domains and Sub-Domains**]{.underline}

The three domains in the MWI framework are: Social Determinants of Health, Healthcare Access, and Health Status. These are distinct and influence one another (they do not overlap). Each domain includes a set of measures, each measure belongs to a single domain. To learn more about the measures under each domain, you can refer to the "Measures and Data Sources" section.

1.  **Social Determinants of Health:** the social, economic, environmental, and structural conditions that influence a community's mental wellness and quality of life. There are 15 measures in this domain, organized under the following sub-domains:
    -   **Built Environment:** The physical parts of where people live and work.
    -   **Education Success:** Ability to receive formal education and to achieve graduation outcomes.
    -   **Income & Employment:** Income earned in comparison to the federal poverty level and employment status.
    -   **Housing:** Living space affordability, quality, and economic and racial/ethnic spatial polarization.
    -   **Social Capital:** Refers to the resources to which individuals and groups have access through their social networks .
    -   **Safety and Community Trauma:** Factors contributing to community members living in peace, harmony, and mutual respect.
    -   **Financial Access:** Availability and affordability of financial services for individuals in a community.
2.  **Healthcare Access:** Access to traditional healthcare systems, accounting for quality, financial, geographic, and other considerations. There are 3 measures in this domain, organized under the following sub-domains:
    -   **Treatment Facilities:** Access to physical locations providing appropriate medical treatment.
    -   **Health Insurance:** Service covering some or all health and medical cost. To be covered by this service, people are required to make a monthly payment. The monthly payment is required even if the service is not used.
3.  **Health Status:** mental health, substance use, and other morbidity and mortality measures that are linked to mental wellness. There are 10 measures in this domain, organized under the following sub-domains:
    -   **Substance Use:** Mortality from and frequency of substance use behaviors at a community level.
    -   **Mental Health:** Emotional, psychological, and social well-being of communities.
    -   **Other Morbidity and Mortality:** Other forms of morbidity and mortality correlated with mental wellness.

[**Dynamic Factors**]{.underline}

*Community & Cultural Assets* and *Structural Racism* acknowledge the positive and negative influences of human factors that influence outcomes and the distribution of assets and obstacles for measures in all three domains:

**Community & Cultural Assets:** Resources in the form of people, places, and organizations that promote social connection and improve the health and wellbeing of the community.[^1] [^2]

Community & cultural assets influence all measures in the MWI. Community & cultural assets are challenging to quantify because they are often not measured in national datasets, but they have an important influence on community mental wellness. One example of a measure where community and cultural assets can be seen prominently is "third places," which measures the number of places where people spend time outside of their homes ("first place") and their workplaces ("second place"), per 100,000 people.

**Structural Racism:** The macrolevel systems, social forces, institutions, ideologies, and processes that interact with one another to generate and reinforce inequities among racial and ethnic groups.[^3]

Structural racism influences all measures in the MWI. Structural racism harms society as a whole, not only Black populations and other people of color. Structural racism operates on many levels, often intersecting with other "isms" (sexism, classism, etc.) and has cascading effects that are often unnamed and seemingly unnoticed. These cascading effects highlight the importance of our approach for developing the MWI---that equity delivered to historically marginalized populations will accrue to others and potentially catalyzes movement toward social and racial justice. One example of a measure where structural racism can be seen prominently is the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (a proxy for residential segregation).
